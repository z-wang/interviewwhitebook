What is Usability Testing?
Usability testing refers to evaluating a specific parts or factors of a product or service by testing it with representative users. During a test, participants will try to complete typical tasks while observers watch, listen and take notes.  The goal is to identify any usability problems, collect qualitative and quantitative data and determine the participant's satisfaction with the product.
To run an effective usability test, you need to develop a solid test plan, recruit participants , and then analyse and report your findings.

Benefits of Usability Testing
Usability testing lets the design and development teams identify problems before they are coded. The earlier issues are identified and fixed, the less expensive the fixes will be in terms of both staff time and possible impact to the schedule.  During a usability test, you will:
•	Learn if participants are able to complete specified tasks successfully 
•	Identify how long it takes to complete specified tasks
•	Find out how satisfied participants are with your product
•	Identify changes required to improve user performance and satisfaction


Example:
Cobe
An Introduction to Usability Testing for Cobe
Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Rebecca I work in SCS Technology. 

Before we start, I am going to give you some information about what you will be doing today and give you time to ask any questions you might have before we get started.

We are asking you as potential user of Cobe to complete a set of tasks. Our goal is to see how easy or difficult you find the application to use and whether it works as intended. The session should take about 30 minutes.

The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the application, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. In fact, you don’t have to worry about making mistakes. If you have any questions, comments or areas of confusion while you are working, please let us know.

Lastly, I want to inform you that you will be testing a prototype today not the real application, so the data and performance will not be a like for like experience.

Test Facilitator’s Role
My colleagues and I will be taking notes on your experience while using the prototype you will be testing. During this session, I would like you to think aloud as much as possible as you work to complete the tasks provided.

I will not be able to offer any suggestions or hints, but from time to time, we may ask you to clarify what you have said or ask you for information on what you were looking for or what you expect to have happened.

Test Participant’s Role
•	Today I am going to be asking you to look for some information or carry out some tasks and tell me how easy or difficult it was to find the information or carry out those tasks. 

•	Don’t worry about hurting our feelings. We’re doing this to improve the application, so we need to hear your honest opinion. Any comments are welcome.
